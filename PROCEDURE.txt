Stanisgee Project Set Up and Data Acquisition Procedure for Canned NDWI
Johnny Wilkens

Notes:
Code is enclosed in ` ` marks. Ex: `example code` 
These instructions were written for a windows machine, if using a mac or other operating system some editing may be necessary.
This method of data gathering has been superceded. Project files used in this procedure can be found under the "old" folder in the code and data directories.

1: Anaconda Navigator
Download and install Anaconda Navigator from https://anaconda.org/anaconda/anaconda-navigator


2: Google Earth Engine and geetools install
Open Anaconda Navigator and launch the CMD.exe Prompt
Run `conda install -c conda-forge earthengine-api` Select yes to any prompts that may appear
Run `pip install geetools`
*These two functions essentially do the same thing which is install a package from the internet. Conda is usually used but geetools is not in the conda library so pip is used.

3: 00environmentSetUp
Close the CMD.exe Prompt and open jupyter notebooks. Navigate to the code/cannedndwi folder of the stanisgee project folder and open 00environmentSetUp.ipynb.
Run the first cell and complete call necessary steps to get the verification code(use email associated with your google cloud project)
Run the second cell to test if the api is working correctly. It should return the metadata of an image.

4: 01dataCollection
Open 01dataCollection. This script selects and filters imagery(or an image collection in google earth engine terms) and exports it to a specific google drive folder. It is designed to be run multiple times for each year desired.
Create a folder in your google drive to store the image files you will collect.
Edit the Collection Parameters cell so that startDate and endDate define the correct year desired and folderName defines the name of the folder you created to store the image files.

X: Google Colab
If you are having trouble with any installation problems you can also just run these notebooks in google colab. Just open the files in google drive and a colab notebook should open with it. Colab already has the earthengine api installed so it should work seamlessly.
